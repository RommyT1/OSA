// This is a placeholder file to remind you to create icon files
// For a proper extension, you would need to create:
// - osa-16.png (16x16)
// - osa-48.png (48x48)
// - osa-128.png (128x128)

console.log(`
IMPORTANT: You'll need to create osa icon images at different sizes for your extension:

1. osa-16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. osa-48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. osa-128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be stored in the assets/icons/ directory.

You can create these using image editing software or find/adapt suitable
osa images from Adventure Time (respecting copyright/fair use).

For a placeholder, you can use any small image and rename it temporarily.
